If the state legislature cannot pass a plan with 2/3 majority in each legislative chamber, lines are drawn by a nine-member backup commission. If the backup commission does not succeed in creating a plan, the State Supreme Court appoints a Special Master to draw the maps. In 2000, the map was drawn by the backup commission, and in 2010 and 2020 the map was drawn by a Special Master. The Democratic Party has control of the state legislature.",
